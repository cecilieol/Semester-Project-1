        <p>It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will
            be delivering 3 lectures on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this exciting
            'space'.</p>
        <h2>Night in the Museum</h2>
        <p>Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over beside dinosaurs and science

        <h2>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h2>
        <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
            Science Museum. It's a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements
            as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to 'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able
            to use and control wind to create power.</p>
