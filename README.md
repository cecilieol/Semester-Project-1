At the end of the first semester at Noroff, we were tasked with creating a website for a Community Science Museum. The website was initially built with HTML and CSS only, but some JavaScript was implemented later when improving the website.

## Brief
"An interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum is opening in your town/city. Its core target audience is primary and middle school children (7-15) and families with young children. The museum wants a website that is informative and appealing, that will attract both middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is inquisitive and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself. The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices."

## Built with
